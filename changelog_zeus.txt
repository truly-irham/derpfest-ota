DerpFest 14 STABLE | UNOFFICIAL ~ by @truly_irham a.k.a rpi_luver
Build Date : 2024-06-19
Device : Xiaomi 12 Pro ( dagda a.k.a zeus )


Device Changelog:

- FOD bug should be fixed entirely even after calling
- Added single tap to wake gesture (Display > Lock Screen > Tap to check phone)


Rom Changelog:

- Merge June security patches 
- Allowed to disable colored lockscreen clock 
- Replace Glimpse with FossifyGallery

Notes:

- Signed build: Dirty flashing works over my previous builds, but if you ever want to roll back to my previous unsigned builds, it WILL NOT WORK unless if it's a clean flash. But don't worry, all builds after this can be dirty flashed as usual, since they will be signed with the same key. To further illustrate this:
      *unsinged build -----dirty flash-----> signed build :works
      *singed build -----dirty flash-----> signed build :works
      *signed build -----dirty flash-----> unsigned build :WONT WORK
- Fully based on Arian's OSS device and OSS kernel trees with extra pinches of salt on top of it. - Credits: @ArianK16a and @Adrianyyyy - Sources: https://github.com/truly-irham/local_manifests
- HyperOS firmware (V816.0.2.0.ULBCNXM) is included in this build

- Basic Call Recorder (BCR) and GAPPS are installed by default
- HyperOS MIUI Camera is included - Credits: @ArianK16a
- OTA is supported
- Fast charging is enabled by default
